## **5.Conclusion**

The data from the first quarter of 2024 shows that “Sol Acres” significantly leads in resale volumes, hinting at its market desirability, possibly due to a balance of affordability and attractive amenities. This project’s success may be a key indicator for those seeking value-for-money investments. In contrast, luxury segments like “The Sail \@ Marina Bay” exhibit a wide price range, indicating a market for buyers with a taste for exclusivity and willingness to pay a premium for distinctive features.

For Consumers: Buyers should align their choices with their priorities: affordability may lead them to high-volume projects, while unique, high-quality features could draw them towards premium segments. When considering investment, a diversified approach that includes stable, high-volume properties and selective, high-value opportunities may offer balanced returns.
