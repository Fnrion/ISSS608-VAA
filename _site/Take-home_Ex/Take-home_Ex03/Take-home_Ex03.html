<p>It is interesting to find that there is one complicated center which connected entities like “Hart Ltd”, “Johnson, Morales and Castro”, which showed a high cooperation and organiztion between current fish companies. And it might be interested to dig the development based on timeline or the financial situation to define its influence. What’s more, even if some points are on the very outside, they still have a sound connection with certain company maybe the supplier or retailer.</p>

<p>``` ## 5.Conclusion</p>
<p>Exploring the networks between the various type of nodes or players in the space has been useful to visualising the relationships between the different parties. It has yielded interesting insights on how certain companies may influence the around companies.</p>
<p>For future work, the additional column of timeline and financial situation can be used to provide an additional layer of to the overall visualisation of networks and information in this project.</p>
